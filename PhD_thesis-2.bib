abstract="Following Brown (Phys Rev D79:104029, 2009), in this paper we give an overview of how to modify standard hyperbolic formulations of the 3+1 evolution equations of General Relativity in such a way that all auxiliary quantities are true tensors, thus allowing for these formulations to be used with curvilinear sets of coordinates such as spherical or cylindrical coordinates. After considering the general case for both the Nagy--Ortiz--Reula and the Baumgarte--Shapiro--Shibata--Nakamura (BSSN) formulations, we specialize to the case of spherical symmetry and also discuss the issue of regularity at the origin. Finally, we show some numerical examples of the modified BSSN formulation at work in spherical symmetry.",

abstract = "The lack of regularity of geometric variables at the origin is often a source of serious problems for spherically symmetric evolution codes in numerical relativity. One usually deals with this by restricting the gauge and solving the hamiltonian constraint for the metric. Here we present a generic algorithm for dealing with the regularization of the origin that can be used directly on the evolution equations and that allows very general gauge choices. Our approach is similar in spirit to the one introduced by Arbona and Bona for the particular case of the Bona–Massó formulation. However, our algorithm is more general and can be used with a wide variety of evolution systems."

abstract="Several interesting astrophysical phenomena are symmetric with respect to the rotation axis, like the head-on collision of compact bodies, the collapse and/or accretion of fields with a large variety of geometries, or some forms of gravitational waves. Most current numerical relativity codes, however, cannot take advantage of these symmetries due to the fact that singularities in the adapted coordinates, either at the origin or at the axis of symmetry, rapidly cause the simulation to crash. Because of this regularity problem it has become common practice to use full-blown Cartesian three-dimensional codes to simulate axi-symmetric systems. In this work we follow a recent idea of Rinne and Stewart and present a simple procedure to regularize the equations both in spherical and axi-symmetric spaces. We explicitly show the regularity of the evolution equations, describe the corresponding numerical code, and present several examples clearly showing the regularity of our evolutions.",

abstract="Equations arising in general relativity are usually too complicated to be solved analytically and one must rely on numerical methods to solve sets of coupled partial differential equations. Among the possible choices, this paper focuses on a class called spectral methods in which, typically, the various functions are expanded in sets of orthogonal polynomials or functions. First, a theoretical introduction of spectral expansion is given with a particular emphasis on the fast convergence of the spectral approximation. We then present different approaches to solving partial differential equations, first limiting ourselves to the one-dimensional case, with one or more domains. Generalization to more dimensions is then discussed. In particular, the case of time evolutions is carefully studied and the stability of such evolutions investigated. We then present results obtained by various groups in the field of general relativity by means of spectral methods. Work, which does not involve explicit time-evolutions, is discussed, going from rapidly-rotating strange stars to the computation of black-hole-binary initial data. Finally, the evolution of various systems of astrophysical interest are presented, from supernovae core collapse to black-hole-binary mergers.",

We adopt a standard 3+1 formalism for the evolution of geometric variables incorporating a swarm of collisionless particles as a source of the energy momentum tensor. In order to determine black hole formation, we also incorporate an apparent horizon finder which was recently developed. Assuming triplane symmetries with respect to x−y, y−z and z−x planes, we have performed a variety of simulations for black hole formation, such as the collapse of triaxial ellipsoids, collapse of spheroids of co-rotating and counter-rotating particles, and head-on collision of two nearly equilibrium spherical clusters, as well as test-bed simulations including spherical symmetric dust collapse. We present numerical results and demonstrate that using our numerical code, we can investigate black hole formation in these problems fairly accurately.}",

abstract="We perform a canonical analysis of the bimetric theory in the metric formulation, computing the constraints and their algebra explicitly. In particular, we compute a secondary constraint, that has been argued to exist earlier, and show that it has the correct form to eliminate the ghost. We also identify a set of four first class constraints that generate the algebra of general covariance. The covariance algebra naturally determines a spacetime metric for the theory. However, in bimetric theory, this metric is not unique but depends on how the first class constraints are identified.",

In order to determine black hole formation, we also incorporate an apparent horizon finder which was recently developed. Assuming triplane symmetries with respect to x−y, y−z and z−x planes, we have performed a variety of simulations for black hole formation, such as the collapse of triaxial ellipsoids, collapse of spheroids of co-rotating and counter-rotating particles, and head-on collision of two nearly equilibrium spherical clusters, as well as test-bed simulations including spherical symmetric dust collapse.

abstract="We propose and study a new first order version of the ghost-free massive gravity. Instead of metrics or tetrads, it uses a connection together with Plebanski's chiral 2-forms as fundamental variables, rendering the phase space structure similar to that of SU(2) gauge theories. The chiral description simplifies computations of the constraint algebra, and allows us to perform the complete canonical analysis of the system. In particular, we explicitly compute the secondary constraint and carry out the stabilization procedure, thus proving that in general the theory propagates 7 degrees of freedom, consistently with previous claims. Finally, we point out that the description in terms of 2-forms opens the door to an infinite class of ghost-free massive bi-gravity actions. Our results apply directly to Euclidean signature. The reality conditions to be imposed in the Lorentzian signature appear to be more complicated than in the usual gravity case and are left as an open issue.",

This shifts the traditional view of matrices as indexed structures to a type-level perspective analogous to that of the pointfree algebra of programming. The derivation of fusion, cancellation and abide laws from the biproduct equations makes it easy to calculate algorithms implementing matrix multiplication, the central operation of matrix algebra, ranging from its divide-and-conquer version to its vectorization implementation. From errant attempts to learn how particular products and coproducts emerge from biproducts, not only blocked matrix algebra is rediscovered but also a way of extending other operations (e.g. Gaussian elimination) blockwise, in a calculational style, is found. The prospect of building biproduct-based type checkers for computer algebra systems such as Matlab™ is also considered."

Generalizing earlier work in spherical symmetry, we characterize the Killing states of the Bona–Massó slicing condition with time derivative along the normals to the slice (‘BMn’) as solutions of a mixed elliptic/hyperbolic differential equation on the slice. We show numerically in spherical symmetry that these steady states can be reached as end states from typical initial data with excision but can be reached with the puncture method only if the puncture is not numerically well resolved. As pointed out in [19] the moving puncture method typically uses a shift that systematically underresolves the puncture, and thus this method becomes a type of excision. During the evolution, BMn slicings often form gauge shocks. It may be that these are not seen in current 3D simulations only through the systematic underresolution provided by the shift, although we expect that they can be avoided with some care. Finally we point out that excision with BMn as currently implemented is ill-posed and therefore not expected to converge; this can be cured. In technical appendices, we derive the equations of pure gauge systems on a fixed spacetime, and bring the BSSN/NOR equations into three-dimensional tensor form suitable for multiple coordinate patches or spherical polar coordinates.}

We will outline its history and its development as a nontrivial extension and generalisation of nonlinear massive gravity. We present a detailed discussion of the consistency proofs of both theories, before we review Einstein solutions to the bimetric equations of motion in vacuum as well as the resulting mass spectrum. We introduce couplings to matter and then discuss the general relativity and massive gravity limits of bimetric theory, which correspond to decoupling the massive or the massless spin-2 field from the matter sector, respectively. More general classical solutions are reviewed and the present status of bimetric cosmology is summarised. An interesting corner in the bimetric parameter space which could potentially give rise to a nonlinear theory for partially massless spin-2 fields is also discussed. Relations to higher-curvature theories of gravity are explained and finally we give an overview of possible extensions of the theory and review its formulation in terms of vielbeins.}

abstract="We consider a manifold endowed with two different vielbeins {\$}{\{}E^A{\}}{\_}{\{}{\backslash}mu {\}}{\$}and {\$}{\{}L^A{\}}{\_}{\{}{\backslash}mu {\}}{\$}corresponding to two different metrics {\$}{\{}g{\_}{\{}{\{}{\backslash}mu {\backslash}nu {\}}{\}}{\}}{\$}and f$\mu$$\nu$. Such a situation arises generically in bimetric or massive gravity (including the recently discussed version of de Rham, Gabadadze and Tolley), as well as in perturbative quantum gravity where one vielbein parametrizes the background space-time and the other the dynamical degrees of freedom. We determine the conditions under which the relation {\$}{\{}g^{\{}{\{}{\backslash}mu {\backslash}nu {\}}{\}}{\}}{\{}E^A{\}}{\_}{\{}{\backslash}mu {\}}{\{}L^B{\}}{\_}{\{}{\backslash}nu {\}}={\{}g^{\{}{\{}{\backslash}mu {\backslash}nu {\}}{\}}{\}}{\{}E^B{\}}{\_}{\{}{\backslash}mu {\}}{\{}L^A{\}}{\_}{\{}{\backslash}nu {\}}{\$}can be imposed (or the ``Deser-van Nieuwenhuizen'' gauge chosen). We clarify and correct various statements which have been made about this issue. We show in particular that in D = 4 dimensions, this condition is always equivalent to the existence of a real matrix square root of {\$}{\{}g^{\{}-1 {\}}{\}}{\$}f.",

abstract = "The lack of regularity of geometric variables at the origin is often a source of serious problems for spherically symmetric evolution codes in numerical relativity. One usually deals with this by restricting the gauge and solving the hamiltonian constraint for the metric. Here we present a generic algorithm for dealing with the regularization of the origin that can be used directly on the evolution equations and that allows very general gauge choices. Our approach is similar in spirit to the one introduced by Arbona and Bona for the particular case of the Bona–Massó formulation. However, our algorithm is more general and can be used with a wide variety of evolution systems."

This secondary spin-2 field is also dynamical, and to avoid the Boulware-Deser ghost issue, the interaction between the two fields is obtained through a potential that involes the matrix square-root of the tensors. This square-root “quantity” is a linear transformation, herein referred to as the square-root isometry. In this work we explore the conditions for the existence of the square-root isometry and its group properties. Morever we study the conditions for the simultaneous 3+1 decomposition of two fields, and then, in terms of null-cones, give the (local) causal relations between fields coupled by the square-root isometry. Finally, we show the algebraic equivalency of bimetric theory and its vielbein formulation up to a one-to-one map relating the respective parameter spaces over the real numbers. },

abstract="The ghost-free bimetric theory describes interactions of gravity with another spin-2 field in terms of two Lorentzian metrics. However, if the two metrics do not admit compatible notions of space and time, the formulation of the initial value problem becomes problematic. Furthermore, the interaction potential is given in terms of the square root of a matrix which is in general nonunique and possibly nonreal. In this paper we show that both these issues are evaded by requiring reality and general covariance of the equations. First we prove that the reality of the square root matrix leads to a classification of the allowed metrics in terms of the intersections of their null cones. Then, the requirement of general covariance further restricts the allowed metrics to geometries that admit compatible notions of space and time. It also selects a unique definition of the square root matrix. The restrictions are compatible with the equations of motion. These results ensure that the ghost-free bimetric theory can be defined unambiguously and that the two metrics always admit compatible 3+1 decompositions, at least locally. In particular, these considerations rule out certain solutions of massive gravity with locally Closed Causal Curves, which have been used to argue that the theory is acausal.",

We investigate the general system that admits a reduction to first order and give necessary and sufficient criteria for strong/symmetric hyperbolicity of the reduction in terms of the principal part of the original second-order system. An alternative definition of strong hyperbolicity is based on the existence of a complete set of characteristic variables, and an alternative definition of symmetric hyperbolicity is based on the existence of a conserved (up to lower-order terms) energy. Both these definitions are made without any explicit reduction. Finally, strong hyperbolicity can be defined through a pseudo-differential reduction to first order. We prove that both definitions of symmetric hyperbolicity are equivalent and that all three definitions of strong hyperbolicity are equivalent (in three space dimensions). We show how to impose maximally dissipative boundary conditions on any symmetric hyperbolic second-order system. We prove that if the second-order system is strongly hyperbolic, any closed constraint evolution system associated with it is also strongly hyperbolic, and that the characteristic variables of the constraint system are derivatives of a subset of the characteristic variables of the main system, with the same speeds.}

When species in the matter sector couple covariantly to only one metric, we show that at one-loop these couplings do not spoil the special structure of the graviton potential. When the same species couples directly to both metrics we show that a ghost is present at the classical level and that loops destroy the special structure of the potential at an unacceptably low scale. We then propose a new ‘composite’ effective metric built out of both metrics. When matter fields couple covariantly to this effective metric, the would be Boulware–Deser (BD) ghost is absent in different representative limits. At one-loop such couplings do not detune the special structure of the potential. We conjecture that matter can couple covariantly to that effective metric in all generality without introducing any BD ghost below a cut-off scale parametrically larger than the strong coupling scale. We also discuss alternative couplings to matter where the kinetic and potential terms of the matter field couple to different metrics. In both cases we discuss preliminary implications for cosmology.}

In this paper we analyse the spectrum of the ghost-free bimetric theory in arbitrary dimensions. Using a recently proposed construction, we identify the candidate nonlinear partially massless (PM) theories. It is shown that, in a 2-derivative setup, nonlinear PM theories can exist only in three and four dimensions. But on adding Lanczos–Lovelock terms to the bimetric action it is found that higher derivative nonlinear PM theories could also exist in higher dimensions. This is consistent with existing results on the direct construction of cubic vertices with PM gauge symmetry. We obtain the candidate nonlinear PM theories in five, six and eight dimensions but find that none exist in seven dimensions.}

    abstract = { Throughout the Universe many powerful events are driven by strong gravitational effects that require general relativity to fully describe them. These include compact binary mergers, black hole accretion, and stellar collapse, where velocities can approach the speed of light and extreme gravitational fields (ΦNewt/c2≃1) mediate the interactions. Many of these processes trigger emission across a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Compact binaries further source strong gravitational wave emission that could directly be detected in the near future. This feat will open up a gravitational wave window into our Universe and revolutionize our understanding of it. Describing these phenomena requires general relativity, and—where dynamical effects strongly modify gravitational fields—the full Einstein equations coupled to matter sources. Numerical relativity is a field within general relativity concerned with studying such scenarios that cannot be accurately modeled via perturbative or analytical calculations. In this review, we examine results obtained within this discipline, with a focus on its impact in astrophysics. }

    abstract = { The construction of numerical solutions of Einstein's General Relativity equations is formulated as an initial-value problem. The space-plus-time (3 + 1) decomposition of the spacetime metric tensor is used to discuss the structure of the field equations. The resulting evolution system is shown to depend in a crucial way on the coordinate gauge. The mandatory use of singularity avoiding coordinate conditions (like maximal slicing or similar gauges) is explained. A brief historical review of Numerical Relativity is included, showing the enormous effort in constructing codes based in these gauges, which lead to non-hyperbolic evolution systems, using "ad hoc" numerical techniques. A new family of first order hyperbolic evolution systems for the vacuum Einstein field equations in the harmonic slicing gauge is presented. This family depends on a symmetric 3 × 3 array of parameters which can be used to scale the dynamical variables in future numerical applications. }

	title = {Numerical relativity using a generalized harmonic decomposition},
	journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
	abstract = {A new numerical scheme to solve the Einstein field equations based upon the generalized harmonic decomposition of the Ricci tensor is introduced. The source functions driving the wave equations that define generalized harmonic coordinates are treated as independent functions, and encode the coordinate freedom of solutions. Techniques are discussed to impose particular gauge conditions through a specification of the source functions. A 3D, free evolution, finite difference code implementing this system of equations with a scalar field matter source is described. The second-order-in-space-and-time partial differential equations are discretized directly without the use of first-order auxiliary terms, limiting the number of independent functions to 15—ten metric quantities, four source functions and the scalar field. This also limits the number of constraint equations, which can only be enforced to within truncation error in a numerical free evolution, to four. The coordinate system is compactified to spatial infinity in order to impose physically motivated, constraint-preserving outer boundary conditions. A variant of the cartoon method for efficiently simulating axisymmetric spacetimes with a Cartesian code is described that does not use interpolation, and is easier to incorporate into existing adaptive mesh refinement packages. Preliminary test simulations of vacuum black-hole evolution and black-hole formation via scalar field collapse are described, suggesting that this method may be useful for studying many spacetimes of interest.}

The toolkit, developed by a collaboration involving researchers from multiple institutions around the world, combines a core set of components needed to simulate astrophysical objects such as black holes, compact objects, and collapsing stars, as well as a full suite of analysis tools. The Einstein Toolkit is currently based on the Cactus framework for high-performance computing and the Carpet adaptive mesh refinement driver. It implements spacetime evolution via the BSSN evolution system and general relativistic hydrodynamics in a finite-volume discretization. The toolkit is under continuous development and contains many new code components that have been publicly released for the first time and are described in this paper. We discuss the motivation behind the release of the toolkit, the philosophy underlying its development, and the goals of the project. A summary of the implemented numerical techniques is included, as are results of numerical test covering a variety of sample astrophysical problems.}

For focusing singularities, I extend the original analysis of Bona et al and show that both marginal and strong singularity avoidance can be obtained for certain types of behaviour of the slicing condition as the lapse approaches zero. For the case of gauge shocks, I rederive a condition found previously that eliminates them. Unfortunately, such a condition limits considerably the type of slicings allowed. However, useful slicing conditions can still be found if one asks for this condition to be satisfied only approximately. Such less restrictive conditions include a particular member of the 1+log family, which in the past has been found empirically to be extremely robust for both Brill wave and black-hole simulations.}

    abstract = { The author's generalized procedure for putting a theory into Hamiltonian form is applied to Einstein’s theory of gravitation. It is shown that one can make a change in the action density, not affecting the equations of motion, which causes four of the ten degrees of freedom associated with the ten gµν to drop out of the Hamiltonian formalism. This simplification can be achieved only at the expense of abandoning four-dimensional symmetry. In the weak field approximation one can make a Fourier resolution of the field quantities, and one then gets a clean separation of those degrees of freedom whose variables depend on the system of co-ordinates from those whose variables do not. There are four of the former and two of the latter for each Fourier component. The two latter correspond to gravitational waves with two independent states of polarization. One of the four former is responsible for the Newtonian attraction between masses and also gives a negative gravitational self-energy for each mass. }

At t=0, we solve the constraint equations to determine the initial data of the metric tensors and the extrinsic curvatures under given angular momentum distribution and baryon number distribution. An example of the initial data is shown. At later time the evolution equations of the metric and the hydrodynamics equations are solved. The constraint equations are not solved but used to see the accuracy of the numerical calculation. The details of the numerical techniques are shown for the spherically symmetric case.}",

    abstract = { The metric of a perturbed Robertson–Walker space–time is characterized by three functions: a scale-factor giving the expansion history and two potentials that generalize the single potential of Newtonian gravity. The Newtonian potential induces peculiar velocities and, from these, the growth of matter fluctuations. Massless particles respond equally to the Newtonian potential and to a curvature potential. The difference of the two potentials, called the gravitational slip, is predicted to be very small in general relativity, but can be substantial in modified gravity theories. The two potentials can be measured, and gravity tested on cosmological scales, by combining weak gravitational lensing or the integrated Sachs–Wolfe effect with galaxy peculiar velocities or clustering. }
